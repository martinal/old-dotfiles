"                  
" `idearefactormode` `idearefactormode` String(default "select")
" 
"              Define the mode that would be enabled during
"              the refactoring (renaming, live template, introduce variable, etc)
"              
"              Use one of the following values:
"              - keep  - keep the mode that was enabled before starting a refactoring
"              - select - start refactoring in select mode
"              - visual - start refactoring in visual mode

"              This option has effect if you are in normal, insert or replace mode before refactoring start.
"              Visual or select mode are not changed.

"               DEPRECATED. Please use `ideastatusicon`
" 
"               If false, IdeaVim icon won't be shown in the status bar.
"               Works only from `~/.ideavimrc` after the IDE restart.

"               Value "all" enables execution of ":wa" (save all) command on ":w" (save).
"               This feature exists because some IJ options like "Prettier on save" or "ESlint on save"
"                    work only with "save all" action. If this option is set to "all", these actions work
"                    also with ":w" command.
